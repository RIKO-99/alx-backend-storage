Redis is an open-source, in-memory data store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker. It is known for its high-performance, low-latency data retrieval, and support for various data structures

Key Features:

In-Memory Data Storage: Redis primarily stores data in RAM, which makes it extremely fast for data retrieval and storage. However, it can also persist data to disk if needed.

Data Structures: Redis supports a wide range of data structures, such as strings, lists, sets, hashes, bitmaps, and more. This allows you to use Redis for a variety of data storage and processing tasks.

Use Cases:

Caching: Redis is commonly used as a cache to store frequently accessed data, reducing the load on primary databases and improving application performance.

Session Store: Redis can be used to manage user sessions in web applications, providing fast and efficient access to session data.

It's important to note that Redis is an in-memory data store, and the amount of data it can store is limited by available RAM. If durability (data persistence) is a critical requirement, you should configure Redis to periodically save data to disk or consider using other databases alongside Redis for durability.
